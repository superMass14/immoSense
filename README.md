# House Sales Price Prediction Competition - ImmoSense 🏡💰

This project aims to analyze data about houses and predict the sales price. 📊

---

## 🔎 Project Overview

When buyers describe their dream home, they often focus on aspects like the number of bedrooms or the presence of a garden. 🌳🏠 However, many hidden factors, such as basement height or proximity to a railway 🚂, also influence the final sale price. Through a vigorous analysis, we explain how these hidden factors impact the price. 🔍💡
